After graduating from a Master in Finance at Toulouse School of Management, Alexandre worked with regenerative companies to help them in their funding round. He quickly thought about how unsustainable our current financial market is and reflecting on how can we make this system more devoted to collaboration instead of competition. Believing that digital currencies can solve a lot economical problems, he joined ThreeFold because it is perfectly aligned with his vision of enhancing peopleâ€™s life on this earth. Being an artist-painter on the side, he is creating an online gallery which will promote and support international artists whose inspirations come from their deep connection with nature. He has the aim of bridging the creative world with the business world.
