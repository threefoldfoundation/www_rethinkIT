Over the past four days, we have had the pleasure to host the African Regenerative Cities Summit in Zanzibar, Tanzania ‚Äì uniting top innovators and investors supporting human flourishing, with a special focus on science and technology that will lay the foundation for Africa‚Äôs future.

<br/>

A lot has happened over the course of the summit, including a surprise visit today from an extremely special guest.

<br/>

Generally, we have been blown away by the participants and the projects they are working on, and we warmly welcome many of them now into the ThreeFold community.

<br/>

We'll be sharing more in the coming days.
