This past weekend, we were honored with a visit from Zanzibar's President Dr. Hussein Mwinyi at the African Regenerative Cities Summit.

<br/>

There, he formally and publicly expressed the government's commitment to the establishment of a digital free zone, a locally-owned Internet infrastructure, an incubator to support young local innovators â€“ all in collaboration with ThreeFold â€“ and their commitment to the ICT sector as a whole.
