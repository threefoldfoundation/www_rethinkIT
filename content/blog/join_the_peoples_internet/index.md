Yes, that's right. With ThreeFold, you *can* become the Internet! Let me quickly explain. 
<br/>
<br/>
Today's Internet is powered by hyper-scale data centers which are owned by large corporations. With +80% of the global infrastructure and +60% of the global Internet networks owned by a bunch of companies, the Internet became a real business with us humans being the products of that business model.
<br/>
<br/>
ThreeFold creates an entirely new Internet economy that is owned by all of us and makes the traditional cloud model of building data centers obsolete. With ThreeFold, independent people called "Farmers" plug in 3Nodes (hardware) from their homes or offices anywhere around the world. And they earn income for it. 
<br/>
<br/>
Together, they power a new, data-sovereign, and planet-positive Internet owned and powered by the people. This is a game-changer.

## So, how do I get a 3Node?

You can buy one of the ready-made nodes from cooperatives around the world. This is a good and very easy way to support the ThreeFold project and to "BE THE INTERNET."
<br/>
<br/>
Today you can buy a 3Node via our website. We are also working with our farming cooperatives to decentralize the provisioning and distribution of hardware to a glocal approach (a global network of local networks). 
<br/>
<br/>
But what if 3Nodes are not immediately available? For example, last week we had a huge influx of orders for our Titan V2 3Nodes and sold out the entire batch with 3,000 extra orders. We're now talking with many hardware distributors to make sure we can satsify all these orders, but this could take a while.
<br/>
<br/>
So if you are a little bit more adventurous, and want to build your 3Node from the ground up, yourself, here's how to do it:
<br/>
<br/>
To "become the Internet" is fairly simple (but does take some technical knowledge and effort). Here's what you'll need:
<br/>
<br/>

- A computer with an INTEL or AMD brain, some memory, and some storage cabilities.
- A smartphone on which you can download and run the "ThreeFold Connect" app. This will provide you with a wallet (to receive your farmed TFT and to pay a very small amount of TFT to get started).
- A laptop / desktop (and USB stick) to launch your online 3Bot, configure your farm, download your bootloader and burn the bootloader to a USB stick.
- Some technical knowledge, interest and 45 minutes of time.
<br/>
<br/>

If you are still here and reading, we're good to go! I go through the whole process in a 3-minute video which will give you a quick overview of how to set up your farm. (Click through to the video on YouTube and find helpful links in the description.)
