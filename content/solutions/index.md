## Challenges in Current Infrastructure

Global economic impacts due to suboptimal internet infrastructure are profound. Countries face substantial losses due to the lack of a self-sufficient internet system. DePIN has the potential to reverse this trend, and give enough Storage, Network, Compute and AI capacity locally in a country. This situation highlights a broader issue where traditional data center models (Tier 3/4) are increasingly inadequate for current technological demands, including DePIN and AI advancements. Furthermore, the limitations of protocol-based DePIN solutions pose a challenge. These solutions, lacking scalability and integration, fail to meet the needs of a globally connected digital future. The necessity for a unified, autonomous IT infrastructure, capable of seamlessly integrating AI, compute, storage, and network capacity on a large scale, is more apparent than ever. This situation demands a rethinking of how we deliver and manage digital infrastructure to avoid fragmentation and inefficiency.
