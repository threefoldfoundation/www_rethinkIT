## Challenges in Current Infrastructure

Global economic impacts due to suboptimal internet infrastructure are profound. Countries face substantial losses due to the lack of a self-sufficient internet system. DePIN can reverse this trend by providing sufficient Storage, Network, Compute and AI capacity locally in every country. Existing protocol-based DePIN solutions lack scalability and integration, often failing to address the needs of a globally connected digital future. The necessity for a unified, autonomous IT infrastructure, capable of seamlessly integrating AI, compute, storage, and network capacity on a large scale, is more apparent than ever. This situation demands a rethinking of how we deliver and manage digital infrastructure to avoid fragmentation and inefficiency.
