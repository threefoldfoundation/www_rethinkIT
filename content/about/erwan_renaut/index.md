Since cloud technology is live, Erwan was always wondering where and how its datas were going to be stored and used. Sovereignty and privacy concerns always made him reluctant in using such services. That's why, after more than a decade working on oil & gas research projects, he was very enthusiastic about joining the Threefold team and contributing to define a new internet paradigm.
