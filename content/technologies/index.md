  ## DePIN

   Countries face substantial losses due to the lack of a self-sufficient internet system. DePIN can reverse this trend by providing Storage, Network, Compute and AI capacity locally in every country. DePIN redefines the development, upkeep, and operation of physical infrastructure within a decentralized framework, leveraging peer-to-peer (P2P) technology. Unlike conventional models led by centralized entities or corporations, these networks are collectively built and governed by a community of participants, thus democratizing ownership and profits associated with physical infrastructure. 

  <br>
  
  Existing protocol-based DePIN solutions lack scalability and integration, often failing to address the needs of a globally connected digital future. The necessity for a unified, autonomous IT infrastructure, capable of seamlessly integrating AI, compute, storage, and network capacity on a large scale, is more apparent than ever. This situation demands a rethinking of how we deliver and manage digital infrastructure to avoid fragmentation and inefficiency.
